    <p class="lead">Another challenging week! Javascript is hard to grasp but I am getting the hang of it. We worked on
     making a weather app that uses an API to call weather data.</p>

    <h1 class="display-4">Week 5</h1>
    <p class="lead">This week was the first week on in-person class. Being in a classroom setting helps me feel more
      focused than if I were at home. We learned about the atomic principles of design, as well as some elements of
      Bootstrap and Javascript.</p>

      push/pull/merge
      sequences on the command line. I was able to add a nav bar to my blog with links.</h4>

    <h1 class="display-4">Week 2</h1>
    <p class="lead">Week 2 consisted of learning some html, css, and pseudocode. I felt pretty comfortable doing all of
      the
      assignments for that since I first learned about them in the intro course. I am still having issues while moving
      files from the local source
      to remote but I am confident that I will figure it out before this class is over. The pseudocode was a little
      frustating because I felt like there are a lot of different ways it can be done.</h4>

    <h1 class="display-4">Week 1</h1>
    <p class="lead">During the first week, we learned mostly about how to use Github. I am confused about pretty much
      all of it.
      Also, I hate blogs. Listening to Slayer and Pantera has been helpful.</h4>
